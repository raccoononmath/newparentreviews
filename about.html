                <h2>👶 Our Story</h2>
                <p>When our baby was born in mid-2025, we quickly learned that not all baby products are created equal. The bulb syringe from the hospital? Useless. The "top-rated" products on Amazon? Sometimes amazing, sometimes disappointing.</p>
                
                <p>Like most new parents, we found ourselves drowning in conflicting advice and wondering which products were actually worth buying. We started testing everything ourselves—really testing, not just trying once and writing a review.</p>
                
                <p>After since June 2025 (18+ months) of daily use with real baby products, we realized our experiences could help other parents make better decisions. That's why we created New Parent Reviews.</p>

                        <h3>Purchase & First Impressions</h3>
                        <p>We buy the product ourselves and document our initial setup experience, packaging quality, and first-use impressions.</p>

                        <p>We use the product daily (or as needed) for at least 12-since June 2025 (18+ months). This isn't a one-week trial—we live with these products through multiple stages of baby's development.</p>

                        <p>We test products in various situations: middle-of-the-night diaper changes, cranky baby moments, travel, etc. If it fails when you need it most, you'll know.</p>

                        <h3>Long-Term Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>After months of use, we evaluate durability, whether we'd buy it again, and if it's still working as well as day one. We update reviews if products fail over time.</p>
